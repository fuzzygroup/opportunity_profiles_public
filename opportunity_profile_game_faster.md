## The Origin Story

A few months ago I had a profound improvement in my personal life. My wife and I live in a large home and every night we stream some media. And, despite having mesh networking throughout our home, we typically end up having streaming failures 3 times a week. 

The improvement in my life?  We reverted to cabled connectivity via a network technology called MOCA which runs Ethernet over the coax cable jacks found in most homes. I, as the house tech nerd, went from explaining what was wrong 3x per week to simply being able to watch a show end to end.  This, honestly, was the real improvement.  Consistent connectivity, today, is the expectation.  And in this particular geography, for whatever reason, it is not readily available.

**Note**: As tech folk, we expect that technology sucks from time to time.  However, the world has mainstreamed technology and real people believe things should simply work.  Both Netflix and Wifi is are 25 year old technologies.  It is actually reasonable for people to expect that they can sit in their bedroom and watch a movie.  They simply don't care that:

* Radio's suck at times
* Steel framing messes with signals
* Broadband all too often comes into the house's machine room

## Who is Alex (See Domain Names Above)?

Alex is my son.  He is a tech nerd and gamer.  He is also, honestly, without direction and underemployed (this is the concept where an individual is working below their capacity).  I wrote this business plan for him.

## What Makes a Business Viable for Thee but Not Me?

I am a strong believer that for any business to succeed, it has to be consonant with the founder / owner / operator's abilities.  By *consonant with*, I mean that there must be alignment between the individuals involved and the market.  This alignment ranges from:

* Capital required
* Skills required

As an example, I have no interest or skills in telephony.  I would be a horrible fit for a business related to telephony despite having technical skills.  However I am expert in DevOps which makes me a great candidate, for example, for something related to deployment and automated infrastructure.

My son has a number of skills:

* Great people skills
* Background doing plumbing (i.e. stream based flow of something; electrons are a stream)
* A deep and abiding love of gaming (the ability to talk to a target market)
* An understanding of any Mom's technology expectations (just make it F'ing work)

## Business Concept: 

WIFI is the essence of modern life but it is showing clear problems in an age of gaming and streaming.  Despite advancements like repeaters and mesh networking, the demands for connectivity strain today's WIFI.  The solution -- electrons over metal aka old fashioned cabling-- is problematic due to the lack of Ethernet cabling in most homes.  A new technology, **MOCA**, allows us to run Ethernet over existing in home cable TV coax lines.  This can be leveraged in existing homes as a way to provide fast connectivity for two targeted markets:

* Better gaming performance
* Better streaming performance

Although positioned as an end user technology, we believe that there is an opportunity for installing MOCA devices provided given proper marketing and targeting.

## Why This Isn't End User Technology

We live in a mid west subdivision where the houses are largely between 10 to 20 years old.  These subdivisions are all built by the same groups of builders with the same general approach.  Subdivisions of this vintage share these properties:

* Average size of 5,000 to 6,000 square feet
* A large number of homes (important for profitability since it allows scheduling multiple visits at the same time)
* Close together (meaning that wifi has cross talk; right now I can see at least 5 networks; go to the other side of the house and I'll see more).
* Although mesh networks are better, most people don't have them and will ONLY ever have the wifi networking that comes from their broadband provider
* Coax wiring to most if not all rooms in the house
* Poor cable management including unlabeled cables

When we initially used MOCA for our own house, this involved a patch box that had too few ports for all the cables, unlabeled cables and cables left hidden in the wall enclosures without BNC connectors.  And this was a house that we know, for a fact, had been serviced by the local subdivision home theatre guru.

Most home owners would have thrown their hands up and returned the MOCA boxes to Amazon with the feeling of being let down by their technology (how we felt with the D-Link and Amplifi mesh networking products we tried).

## Marketing and Business Model 

There are two target markets: Gaming and Streaming media.  Rather than try and figure out which one is the correct one by serial experimentation, we propose developing two web sites based on a common code base:

* GameFasterWithAlex.com (my son is the Alex in question)
* IMakeWifiFaster.com

This is simply A/B testing applied at a much larger scale. 

These two web sites would both allow you to to signup for an installation and prequalify the visit with questions like

Yes / No - Do you have cable TV connectors in the room where you want faster connectivity
Yes / No - How big is your house?
______ - When was it built?
______ - What is your zip code?
______ - How many rooms do you want faster connectivity in?
______ - How often do you have wifi failures ? 

This can all be captured via TypeForm with no software development.

And if you can't answer the questions then we will come out but there is a fee paid in advance of say $50 to $75 for an assessment. 

## Marketing 

The marketing would be simple:

* A flier posed in local coffee shops 
* Postings to local facebook groups / NextDoor newsletters 

The advantage to this approach is that it is a boots on the ground, guerrilla marketing approach with no cash outlay. 

Promotional marketing could include things like "Give your son faster gaming with a hard line".  What affluent parent doesn't need something new and different to give their kid?

## Initial Product

The initial product is a visit from a technician -- think Geek Squad like marketing -- with a set of tools and two or more MOCA boxes.

### Tools Needed

* Tool Caddy
* COAX continuity tester
* Label maker
* Patch Panel
* BNC Crimper
* Electrical Tape
* Extra Power Strips

## Pricing

The model would be priced as:

* Visit Cost
* Power Strip (likely the customer will have shitty electrical and need one)
* MOCA Boxes
* Supplies (connectors)
* Additional time based on the number of ports setup and complexity of the installation based on things like unlabeled cables

## Implementation Schedule

### Week 1

Prove the concept further and experiment with patch box upgrading and identifying unlabeled cables. Gather data on ping time based on distance from the MOCA box attached to the router. 

### Week 2

Setup the typeform instrument to capture visit info for the two different brands. 

### Week 3

* Ask local friends and family to tell us about their wifi, gaming and streaming issues
* Setup initial website

#### Week 4

Make fliers and get them into coffee shops. 

#### Week 5

Service first clients (hopefully)

## Uniqueness: 

At this point this seems to be an unrealized opportunity.  The assumption is that MOCA is an end user technology. On this we disagree. 

## Feedback From Real World Market Research

1. We have done this in our own home. 
2. We have confirmed that one neighbor's home has a similar configuration -- coax to every room. 
3. We have confirmed that new (2021) construction does not have coax at all. 
4. We need a broader set of people to talk to.

## Competition

We are not aware of anyone offering this.
